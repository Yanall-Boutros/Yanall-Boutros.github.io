      <h1> About Yanall</h1>
      <p> Graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz in 4 years with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in
      Physics and B.S in Computer Science. I 
      spend most of my time teaching myself skills or hobbies such as: making music, learning cybersecurity,
      earning my pilots license, and DIY raspberry pi projects. Finding pointless ways to integrate applied math and
      AI techniques into my 
      hobbies is another fun way I kill time, however it usually leaves me desiring more.

      My goal is to land a research position with a Quantum Computing firm, which hopefully involves artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.

    <h1>Back End Developer, Researcher </h1>
    <p>
      I bring a wide breadth of 
      knowledge supported with a strong depth of applied logic. Both disciplines have a strong math background, but offer 
      unique perspectives. The math in Computer Science is more abstract, and while it does explore some
      of the problems in solving differential equations or linear algebra, Physics provides a much more advanced,
      rigorous perspective on deriving the models for such problems.

      As you can probably tell by how basic this website is, I am not a web developer.

      Recent contracts:
    </p>
      <ul class="contract_list"> 
        <li> Deriving unique combinatorics based on client information, then writing custom Haskell code</li>
             for data recovery purposes.
        <li> Setting up an internal surveillance network. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Professional Musician </h2>
    <p> 
        I play Piano, Violin, and Trombone. While I record much of my own music (a few loops are featured below) I am not trying to become a professional performer. I 
        still enjoy collaborating with other musicians in composition, and will happily be featured in any 
        tracks they might invite me to help with. For private tutoring, my rate is $50 an hour.

      <h3> Ising Model Simulation </h3>

      <p id="ising_par"> 
        The Ising model displays the thermodynamic properties of a ferromagnet by simulating the interactions of N<sup>2</sup> 
        atoms (or spin-sites) on an N Ã— N grid. In the animation above, energy is gradually increased in time, until the 
        structure of the lattice becomes more chaotic, indicating a phase change. For more information, <a href="images/REPORT.pdf">

        Simulation of needle with surfaces cooled to -20 Celsius and inlet temperature set to a sine function. The simulation
        has been sped up to fit in a gif. In the program, time is an input controlled by a slider. To represent the 
        passage of time in a simulation that's been sped up ~31x, a repeat in the brightness of the pipe indicates ~10 seconds have passed
        in the simulation.
