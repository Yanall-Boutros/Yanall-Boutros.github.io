      <h3> Ising Model Simulation </h3>
      <img id="isingimg" src="images/ising.gif" width=500 height=500> 
      <p id="ising_par"> 
        The Ising model displays the thermodynamic properties of a ferromagnet by simulating the interactions of N<sup>2</sup> 
        atoms (or spin-sites) on an N Ã— N grid. In the animation above, energy is gradually increased in time, until the 
        structure of the lattice becomes more chaotic, indicating a phase change. For more information, <a href="images/REPORT.pdf">

        Simulation of needle with surfaces cooled to -20 Celsius and inlet temperature set to a sine function. The simulation
        has been sped up to fit in a gif. In the program, time is an input controlled by a slider. To represent the 
        passage of time in a simulation that's been sped up ~31x, a repeat in the brightness of the pipe indicates ~10 seconds have passed
        in the simulation.
