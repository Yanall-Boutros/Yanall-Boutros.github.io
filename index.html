      <h1> About Yanall</h1>
      <p> Graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz in 4 years with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in
      Physics and B.S in Computer Science. I 
      spend most of my time teaching myself skills or hobbies such as: making music, learning cybersecurity,
      earning my pilots license, and DIY raspberry pi projects. Finding pointless ways to integrate applied math and
      AI techniques into my 
      hobbies is another fun way I kill time, however it usually leaves me desiring more.

      My goal is to land a research position anywhere which applies artificial intelligence and machine learning 
      techniques, and to support myself
      with the services advertised on this website.</p>
