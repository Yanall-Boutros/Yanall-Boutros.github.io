    <h1> Freelance Developer, Researcher </h1>
    <p>
      With two Bachelors' of Science (B.S) in Physics and Computer Science, I bring a wide breadth of 
      knowledge supported with a strong depth of applied logic. Both disciplines have a strong math background, but offer 
      unique perspectives. The math in Computer Science is more abstract, and while it does explore some
      of the problems in solving differential equations or linear algebra, Physics provides a much more advanced,
      rigorous perspective on deriving the models for such problems.

    <h2> Professional Musician </h2>
    <p> 
        I play Piano, Violin, and Trombone. While I record much of my own music (a few loops are featured below) I am not trying to become a professional performer. I 
        still enjoy collaborating with other musicians in composition, and will happily be featured in any 
        tracks they might invite me to help with. For private tutoring, my rate is $50 an hour.
