          written in Python. Packages such as  Pythia, Pyjet, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow are utilized as the back end to
          simulate events in the Large Hadron Collider. For more information, <a href="images/Boutros, Yanall - Thesis.pdf"> please refer my Senior Thesis here.</a>

        <p id="ising_par"> 
          The Ising model displays the thermodynamic properties of a ferromagnet by simulating the interactions of N<sup>2</sup> 
          atoms (or spin-sites) on an N Ã— N grid. In the animation above, energy is gradually increased in time, until the 
          structure of the lattice becomes more chaotic, indicating a phase change. For more information, <a href="images/REPORT.pdf">

          Simulation of needle with surfaces cooled to -20 Celsius and inlet temperature set to a sine function. The simulation
          has been sped up to fit in a gif. In the program, time is an input controlled by a slider. To represent the 
          passage of time in a gif that's been sped up ~31x, a repeat in the color of the pipe indicates ~10 seconds have passed
          in the simulation.
